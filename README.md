Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?

The client, Liam, and owner of DriverPass purpose is to train students for their driving test at their local department of motor vehicles (DMV) DriverPass intends to provide students with online classes, practice tests, and on the road training.

What did you do particularly well?

I believe I particulary did well in completing the necessary requirements for the DriverPass system. I utilized the transcript it implemented the user needs into the business requirements and then translating the business requirements to the activity diagrams.I also believed I did well in creating the Class Diagram labeling the correct classes and methods within the classes.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

I would revise my activity diagrams as I have a few errors when listing the nodes. I would improve the designs ensuring the correct decision nodes were implemented in the design. By having an incorrect diagram, it would be detrimental in the final process of developing the system.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

I interpeted user needs by reading the transcript and implementing what the user wanted for the system. For example, the user wanted the customer to register by providing a name, email, payment info, phone number, and state. I implemented a class for the customer with the added attributes. User's need are important as the needs are what the system is intended to do. We are creating what the user wants and the more information from the user, the easier it is to implement the needs into the design.

How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?

To design software, I would always first meet with client and have the client list all his requirements for the system he/she is trying to design. I would make sure all the user needs are listed and implemented in the requirement documents. From there on I would identify the major components of the and list how they relate to each other. I would use an iterative process testing the system repetitive until the desired result is met.
